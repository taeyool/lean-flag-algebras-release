# `LeanFlagAlgebras/Flagmatic/` - Flagmatic certificate to Lean automation

This directory is the **main contribution of the accompanying paper**: the
tools that **turn Flagmatic SDP certificates into Lean 4 flag-algebra proofs
automatically**, together with the generated proof artifacts — the seven case
studies evaluated in the paper (Section 5.4).

## Requirements

- **Checking the committed proofs**: nothing beyond the repository's pinned
  Lean toolchain — the certificates (`Certificates/*.json`) and the proof
  files generated from them (`*.lean`) are both checked in, and `lake build`
  re-verifies everything.
- **Running `flagmatic_to_lean.py`**: Python 3, standard library only.
- **Producing new SDP certificates**:
  [Flagmatic](https://github.com/jsliacan/flagmatic), which runs under
  [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/). The seven committed certificates are
  Flagmatic's output as produced.

## One-line automation

```powershell
python LeanFlagAlgebras/Flagmatic/flagmatic_to_lean.py gen-skeleton `
    LeanFlagAlgebras/Flagmatic/Certificates/<Name>_cert.json `
    LeanFlagAlgebras/Flagmatic/<Name>.lean `
    --namespace <Name> --force
```

This single command generates imports, opens, namespace declarations, the
`generate_forbid_free_*` commands, matrix/PSD proofs, sigma/v definitions, and
the main theorem (auto-proved by tactics). Evaluation mode: `decide +kernel`
by default, `--native-decide` to switch the generated file to `native_decide`.

For other subcommands, run `python flagmatic_to_lean.py --help` or check the
docstring at the top of `flagmatic_to_lean.py`.

## The seven paper cases (Section 5.4)

| File | Forbid `H` | Target `F` | `N` | Blocks | Bound | Checked by |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Mantel.lean` | K₃ | edge | 3 | 1 | `1/2` | `decide +kernel` |
| `K3freeP3.lean` | K₃ | P₃ | 3 | 1 | `3/4` | `decide +kernel` |
| `K3freeC4.lean` | K₃ | C₄ | 4 | 2 | `3/8` | `decide +kernel` |
| `K4freeEdge.lean` | K₄ | edge | 4 | 2 | `2/3` | `decide +kernel` |
| `ErdosPentagon.lean` | K₃ | C₅ | 5 | 3 | `24/625` | `decide +kernel` |
| `K5freeEdge.lean` | K₅ | edge | 5 | 4 | `3/4` | `native_decide` |
| `C5freeEdge.lean` | C₅ | edge | 5 | 4 | `1/2` | `native_decide` |

File and theorem names follow the paper's case table: `<H>free<Target>`, with
the two named cases (`Mantel`, `ErdosPentagon`) kept under their proper names;
each file proves `<cert-stem>_flagAlgebra`.

## Workflow for a new certificate

```powershell
# 1. Optional: mapping sanity check (also validates the cert — every flagmatic
#    string is resolved to a canonical Lean identifier, raising on any failure).
python LeanFlagAlgebras/Flagmatic/flagmatic_to_lean.py inspect <cert>.json

# 2. Generate the Lean file (flags, densities and products are all generated
#    inside Lean by the `generate_forbid_free_*` commands — no JSON files on disk).
python LeanFlagAlgebras/Flagmatic/flagmatic_to_lean.py gen-skeleton `
    LeanFlagAlgebras/Flagmatic/Certificates/<Name>_cert.json `
    LeanFlagAlgebras/Flagmatic/<Name>.lean --namespace <Name> --force

# 3. Build
lake build LeanFlagAlgebras.Flagmatic.<Name>

# 4. Optional: add the import to the root manifest LeanFlagAlgebras.lean
```

## Forbidden graphs

The forbidden graph is read from the certificate's `forbid` clause and emitted
as a `Sym2Graph` **term**: a complete graph `K_r` becomes `completeSym2Graph r`,
any other graph an explicit edge set. Both feed the same
`generate_forbid_free_*` commands, which forbid the graph as a (non-induced)
subgraph and dispatch internally — a complete forbid takes the pruned clique
route, any other the subgraph route. No per-graph registration is needed.

## Flagmatic certificate format (reference)

```json
{
  "description": "2-graph; maximize <objective_str> density; forbid <forbid_str>",
  "bound": "1/2",
  "order_of_admissible_graphs": 3,
  "number_of_admissible_graphs": 3,
  "admissible_graphs": ["3:", "3:12", "3:1213"],
  "number_of_types": 1,
  "types": ["1:"],
  "numbers_of_flags": [2],
  "flags": [["2:(1)", "2:12(1)"]],
  "qdash_matrices": [[[2]]],
  "r_matrices": [[["1/2"], ["-1/2"]]],
  "admissible_graph_densities": [0, "1/3", "2/3"]
}
```

### Flagmatic string encoding

- Vertices are 1-indexed and written as single digits when possible (vertex ≤ 9).
- Edges are encoded as two-digit pairs. For example, `"4:121324"` means vertex 4 with edges {1-2, 1-3, 2-4}.
- Sigma-flag labels use the form `"3:12(2)"`, meaning 3 vertices with the first 2 as type vertices (labels 0 and 1).

### How the automation uses the certificate

| Lean output | Source |
|---|---|
| Objective identifier (e.g. `FlagAlgebra_2_0_0_1`) | `description`'s `maximize ...` clause, resolved by graph isomorphism |
| Forbidden graph term (`completeSym2Graph r` or an explicit `Sym2Graph` edge set) | `description`'s `forbid ...` clause |
| Bound (e.g. `(1 / 2 : ℝ)`) | `cert["bound"]` |
| Host size N | `cert["order_of_admissible_graphs"]` |
| σ_t, v_t | `cert["types"]`, `cert["flags"]` |
| M_t matrix | `R_t · Q'_t · R_tᵀ` (`qdash` stores the upper-triangular rows) |
| LDLᵀ decomposition | Exact rational LDL decomposition computed from `M_t` |
| Objective-expansion auxiliary lemma (targets below the host size) | Exhaustive computation of induced densities over all vertex subsets of the host graph |
