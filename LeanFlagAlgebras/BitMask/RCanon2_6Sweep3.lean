/-! Rooted (2,6) completeness sweep piece 3 of 4: masks `24576`–`32767`.


Machine-generated (see gen_canon.py). The subrange is covered by 8
separate depth-10 kernel evaluations rather than one depth-13
evaluation, so the kernel releases its evaluation cache between
declarations; `sweepMasks_of_pieces` glues them back together. -/
