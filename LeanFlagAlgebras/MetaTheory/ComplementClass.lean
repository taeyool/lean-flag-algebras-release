/-! # Complementation transfers the constrained quotient space (paper `lem:complementation`, Layer 3)

Layers 1–2 (`MetaTheory/FlagComplement.lean`, `MetaTheory/ComplementHom.lean`) build the
complement homeomorphism `complHomeo : PositiveHomSpace σ ≃ₜ PositiveHomSpace σᶜ` acting by
`(complHomeo χ).val G = χ.val G.uncompl`.  This file is **Layer 3**: it complements a *hereditary
graph class* and shows that `complHomeo` carries the constrained quotient space `Q_σ(K)` exactly
onto `Q_{σᶜ}(K̄)`.

* **The complement class.**  `HeredClass.compl hc` is `K̄ = {Ḡ : G ∈ K}` — again hereditary,
  because an induced embedding `H ↪g G` complements to `Hᶜ ↪g Gᶜ` (`complEmbedding`), exactly the
  pattern used for `coC4FreeClass` in `MetaTheory/DenseObstruction.lean`.
* **The forbidden-flag bridge.**  `complClass_forbσ_iff` says a `σᶜ`-flag `G` is forbidden by the
  complement class iff its un-complement `G.uncompl` is forbidden by the original class.  This is
  the load-bearing combinatorial identity: it reduces to
  `(hc.compl).underlyingMem (unlabel G.2) ↔ hc.underlyingMem (unlabel G.uncompl.2)`, both sides of
  which compute to `hc.Mem (Grepᶜ)` after picking a representative.
* **The `Q_σ` transfer (the deliverable).**  `complHomeo_mem_Qσ_iff` transports membership in the
  constrained space across `complHomeo`, and `complHomeo_image_Qσ` upgrades this to the set
  equality `complHomeo '' Q_σ(K) = Q_{σᶜ}(K̄)`.  The mathematical content is the bridge applied
  through the bijection `F ↦ F.compl` (inverse `G ↦ G.uncompl`).

/-! ## A. The complement hereditary class -/

/-- **The complement of a hereditary graph class.**  `K̄ = {Ḡ : G ∈ K}`, i.e. a graph `G` is in
`hc.compl` iff its complement `Gᶜ` is in `hc`.  Again hereditary: an induced embedding `H ↪g G`
complements to an induced embedding `Hᶜ ↪g Gᶜ` (`complEmbedding`), so heredity of `hc` at `Gᶜ`
transports to heredity of `hc.compl` at `G`.  (Mirrors `coC4FreeClass` in
`MetaTheory/DenseObstruction.lean`.) -/

  Mem {_V} _ _ G := hc.Mem Gᶜ

/-! ## B. The forbidden-flag correspondence -/

/-- **The forbidden-flag bridge.**  A `σᶜ`-flag `G` is forbidden by the complement class iff its
un-complement `G.uncompl` is forbidden by the original class.  Both sides unfold to a negated
underlying-membership; choosing a representative `⟦Grep⟧` of `G.2`, each side computes to
`¬ hc.Mem (Grep.graphᶜ)`, so the equivalence is definitional. -/

/-! ## C. Transfer of the constrained quotient space `Q_σ` -/

/-- **Membership transfer.**  `complHomeo χ` lies in the constrained space of the complement class
iff `χ` lies in the constrained space of the original class.  Rewriting both sides with
`mem_Qσ_iff` and `complHomeo_val`, the complement-class condition reindexes along the bijection
`F ↦ F.compl` / `G ↦ G.uncompl` to the original-class condition (via `complClass_forbσ_iff`). -/

    exact hRHS G.uncompl ((complClass_forbσ_iff hc σ G).mp hG)

/-- **The set equality (the deliverable).**  `complHomeo` carries the constrained quotient space of
`hc` exactly onto that of `hc.compl`: `complHomeo '' Q_σ(K) = Q_{σᶜ}(K̄)`.  Both inclusions are
`complHomeo_mem_Qσ_iff` applied through the `complHomeo` bijection. -/
